### Reasons for choosing this tech stack


1) Learning Opportunities: I wanted to delve into new technologies and tools which I haven't explored prior, such as GraphQL, AWS cloud services, and NoSQL databases.

2) Real-Time Capabilities: GraphQL was an ideal choice for real-time data processing and synchronization, due to its efficient data fetching capabilities. Combined with AWS AppSync, I could effortlessly build real-time applications that provide instant updates to users.

3) Scalability and Flexibility: By leveraging AWS cloud services such as AppSync, DynamoDB, and S3, I was able to ensure scalability and flexibility in our application architecture. These services offer managed solutions for data storage, authentication, and serverless functions.

4) Serverless Architecture: AWS Amplify enabled me to adopt a serverless architecture, eliminating the need for provisioning and managing servers. Should the project scale, this approach would reduce operational overhead and infrastructure costs, while ensuring high availability and scalability.

5) Authentication and Authorization: Amazon Cognito provided robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. It also has features like multi-factor authentication and user pool management.

6) Modern Frontend Development: I opted for React as the frontend framework due to its popularity, robust ecosystem, and component-based architecture.


### General idea:
